  - text: "This temple was once a place of balance, a sacred ground watched over
      by our clan. But that balance has shattered. A false god, an evil spirit that
      feeds on delusion and power now festers in the heart of this place. It has
      stolen my strength\u2026 twisted my home into a lair of corruption."
    voiceLine: {fileID: 0}
  - text: "These masks\u2026 they hold what remains of my strength. The spirit tore
      them from me, scattering them across the temple\u2019s domains to weaken me.
      Return them, and I will rise once more whole, and ready to drive the blight
      from these sacred walls."

  - text: I would not have summoned you if there were another way. You are the last
      living heir of our bloodline the final ember of a flame nearly lost to time.
      Only one of our blood can restore the balance, or all will fall into shadow

      poison your days, and twist your fate beyond repair. This is more than duty
      it is surviva"
